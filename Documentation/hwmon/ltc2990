Description
-----------

LTC2990 is a Quad I2C Voltage, Current and Temperature Monitor.
The chip's inputs can measure 4 voltages, or two inputs together (1+2 and 3+4)
can be combined to measure a differential voltage, which is typically used to
<<<<<<< HEAD
measure current through a series resistor, or a temperature with an external
diode.
=======
measure current through a series resistor, or a temperature.

This driver currently uses the 2x differential mode only. In order to support
other modes, the driver will need to be expanded.

Usage Notes
-----------

This driver does not probe for PMBus devices. You will have to instantiate
devices explicitly.


Sysfs attributes
----------------

<<<<<<< HEAD
in0_input     Voltage at Vcc pin in millivolt (range 2.5V to 5V)
temp1_input   Internal chip temperature in millidegrees Celcius

A subset of the following attributes are visible, depending on the measurement
mode of the chip.

in[1-4]_input Voltage at V[1-4] pin in millivolt
temp2_input   External temperature sensor TR1 in millidegrees Celcius
temp3_input   External temperature sensor TR2 in millidegrees Celcius
curr1_input   Current in mA across V1-V2 assuming a 1mOhm sense resistor
curr2_input   Current in mA across V3-V4 assuming a 1mOhm sense resistor

The "curr*_input" measurements actually report the voltage drop across the
input pins in microvolts. This is equivalent to the current through a 1mOhm
sense resistor. Divide the reported value by the actual sense resistor value
in mOhm to get the actual value.
