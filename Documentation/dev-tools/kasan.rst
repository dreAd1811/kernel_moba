The Kernel Address Sanitizer (KASAN)
====================================

Overview
--------

<<<<<<< HEAD
KernelAddressSANitizer (KASAN) is a dynamic memory error detector. It provides
a fast and comprehensive solution for finding use-after-free and out-of-bounds
bugs.

KASAN uses compile-time instrumentation for checking every memory access,
therefore you will need a GCC version 4.9.2 or later. GCC 5.0 or later is
required for detection of out-of-bounds accesses to stack or global variables.

Currently KASAN is supported only for the x86_64 and arm64 architectures.
=======
KernelAddressSANitizer (KASAN) is a dynamic memory error detector designed to
find out-of-bound and use-after-free bugs. KASAN has two modes: generic KASAN
(similar to userspace ASan) and software tag-based KASAN (similar to userspace
HWASan).

KASAN uses compile-time instrumentation to insert validity checks before every
memory access, and therefore requires a compiler version that supports that.

Generic KASAN is supported in both GCC and Clang. With GCC it requires version
4.9.2 or later for basic support and version 5.0 or later for detection of
out-of-bounds accesses for stack and global variables and for inline
instrumentation mode (see the Usage section). With Clang it requires version
7.0.0 or later and it doesn't support detection of out-of-bounds accesses for
global variables yet.

Tag-based KASAN is only supported in Clang and requires version 7.0.0 or later.

Currently generic KASAN is supported for the x86_64, arm64 architectures,
and tag-based KASAN is supported only for arm64.

Usage
-----

To enable KASAN configure kernel with::

	  CONFIG_KASAN = y

<<<<<<< HEAD
and choose between CONFIG_KASAN_OUTLINE and CONFIG_KASAN_INLINE. Outline and
inline are compiler instrumentation types. The former produces smaller binary
the latter is 1.1 - 2 times faster. Inline instrumentation requires a GCC
version 5.0 or later.

KASAN works with both SLUB and SLAB memory allocators.
=======
and choose between CONFIG_KASAN_GENERIC (to enable generic KASAN) and
CONFIG_KASAN_SW_TAGS (to enable software tag-based KASAN).

You also need to choose between CONFIG_KASAN_OUTLINE and CONFIG_KASAN_INLINE.
Outline and inline are compiler instrumentation types. The former produces
smaller binary while the latter is 1.1 - 2 times faster.

Both KASAN modes work with both SLUB and SLAB memory allocators.
>>>>>>> dbca343aea69 (Add 'techpack/audio/' from commit '45d866e7b4650a52c1ef0a5ade30fc194929ea2e')
For better bug detection and nicer reporting, enable CONFIG_STACKTRACE.

To disable instrumentation for specific files or directories, add a line
similar to the following to the respective kernel Makefile:

- For a single file (e.g. main.o)::

    KASAN_SANITIZE_main.o := n

- For all files in one directory::

    KASAN_SANITIZE := n

The header of the report provides a short summary of what kind of bug happened
and what kind of access caused it. It's followed by a stack trace of the bad
access, a stack trace of where the accessed memory was allocated (in case bad
access happens on a slab object), and a stack trace of where the object was
freed (in case of a use-after-free bug report). Next comes a description of
the accessed slab object and information about the accessed memory page.

In the last section the report shows memory state around the accessed address.
Reading this part requires some understanding of how KASAN works.

The state of each 8 aligned bytes of memory is encoded in one shadow byte.
Those 8 bytes can be accessible, partially accessible, freed or be a redzone.
We use the following encoding for each shadow byte: 0 means that all 8 bytes
of the corresponding memory region are accessible; number N (1 <= N <= 7) means
that the first N bytes are accessible, and other (8 - N) bytes are not;
any negative value indicates that the entire 8-byte word is inaccessible.
We use different negative values to distinguish between different kinds of
inaccessible memory like redzones or freed memory (see mm/kasan/kasan.h).

In the report above the arrows point to the shadow byte 03, which means that
the accessed address is partially accessible.

Implementation details
----------------------

<<<<<<< HEAD
From a high level, our approach to memory error detection is similar to that
of kmemcheck: use shadow memory to record whether each byte of memory is safe
to access, and use compile-time instrumentation to check shadow memory on each
memory access.

AddressSanitizer dedicates 1/8 of kernel memory to its shadow memory
(e.g. 16TB to cover 128TB on x86_64) and uses direct mapping with a scale and
offset to translate a memory address to its corresponding shadow address.

Here is the function which translates an address to its corresponding shadow
address::

    static inline void *kasan_mem_to_shadow(const void *addr)
    {
	return ((unsigned long)addr >> KASAN_SHADOW_SCALE_SHIFT)
		+ KASAN_SHADOW_OFFSET;
    }

where ``KASAN_SHADOW_SCALE_SHIFT = 3``.

GCC 5.0 has possibility to perform inline instrumentation. Instead of making
function calls GCC directly inserts the code to check the shadow memory.
This option significantly enlarges kernel but it gives x1.1-x2 performance
boost over outline instrumented kernel.
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

Software tag-based KASAN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tag-based KASAN uses the Top Byte Ignore (TBI) feature of modern arm64 CPUs to
store a pointer tag in the top byte of kernel pointers. Like generic KASAN it
uses shadow memory to store memory tags associated with each 16-byte memory
cell (therefore it dedicates 1/16th of the kernel memory for shadow memory).

On each memory allocation tag-based KASAN generates a random tag, tags the
allocated memory with this tag, and embeds this tag into the returned pointer.
Software tag-based KASAN uses compile-time instrumentation to insert checks
before each memory access. These checks make sure that tag of the memory that
is being accessed is equal to tag of the pointer that is used to access this
memory. In case of a tag mismatch tag-based KASAN prints a bug report.

Software tag-based KASAN also has two instrumentation modes (outline, that
emits callbacks to check memory accesses; and inline, that performs the shadow
memory checks inline). With outline instrumentation mode, a bug report is
simply printed from the function that performs the access check. With inline
instrumentation a brk instruction is emitted by the compiler, and a dedicated
brk handler is used to print bug reports.

A potential expansion of this mode is a hardware tag-based mode, which would
use hardware memory tagging support instead of compiler instrumentation and
manual shadow memory manipulation.
