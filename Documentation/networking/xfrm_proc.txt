Transformation Statistics
-------------------------
<<<<<<< HEAD

The xfrm_proc code is a set of statistics showing numbers of packets
dropped by the transformation code and why.  These counters are defined
as part of the linux private MIB.  These counters can be viewed in
/proc/net/xfrm_stat.

=======
xfrm_proc is a statistics shown factor dropped by transformation
for developer.
It is a counter designed from current transformation source code
and defined like linux private MIB.
