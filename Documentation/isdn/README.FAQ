The FAQ for isdn4linux
======================

Please note that there is a big FAQ available in the isdn4k-utils.
You find it in:
 isdn4k-utils/FAQ/i4lfaq.sgml

In case you just want to see the FAQ online, or download the newest version,
you can have a look at my website:

>>>>>>> dbca343aea69 (Add 'techpack/audio/' from commit '45d866e7b4650a52c1ef0a5ade30fc194929ea2e')

As the extension tells, the FAQ is in SGML format, and you can convert it
into text/html/... format by using the sgml2txt/sgml2html/... tools.
Alternatively, you can also do a 'configure; make all' in the FAQ directory.


Please have a look at the FAQ before posting anything in the Mailinglist,
or the newsgroup!
