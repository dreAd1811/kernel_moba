What:		/sys/bus/rbd/add
Date:		Oct, 2010
KernelVersion:	v2.6.37
Contact:	Sage Weil <sage@newdream.net>
Description:
		(WO) Add rbd block device.

		Usage: <mon ip addr> <options> <pool name> <rbd image name> [<snap name>]

		 $ echo "192.168.0.1 name=admin rbd foo" > /sys/bus/rbd/add

		The snapshot name can be "-" or omitted to map the image
		read/write. A <dev-id> will be assigned for any registered block
		device. If snapshot is used, it will be mapped read-only.


What:		/sys/bus/rbd/remove
Date:		Oct, 2010
KernelVersion:	v2.6.37
Contact:	Sage Weil <sage@newdream.net>
Description:
		(WO) Remove rbd block device.

		Usage: <dev-id> [force]

		 $ echo 2 > /sys/bus/rbd/remove

		Optional "force" argument which when passed will wait for
		running requests and then unmap the image. Requests sent to the
		driver after initiating the removal will be failed. (August
		2016, since 4.9.)


What:		/sys/bus/rbd/add_single_major
Date:		Dec, 2013
KernelVersion:	v3.14
Contact:	Sage Weil <sage@newdream.net>
Description:
		(WO) Available only if rbd module is inserted with single_major
		parameter set to true.

		Usage is the same as for /sys/bus/rbd/add. If present, this
		should be used instead of the latter: any attempts to use
		/sys/bus/rbd/add if /sys/bus/rbd/add_single_major is available
		will fail for backwards compatibility reasons.
