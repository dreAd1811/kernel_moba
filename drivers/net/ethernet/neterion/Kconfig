	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
<<<<<<< HEAD
	  the questions about Neterion/Exar cards. If you say Y, you will be
	  asked for your specific card in the following questions.

	  This driver supports Exar Corp's Xframe Series 10Gb Ethernet Adapters.
	  These were originally released from S2IO, which renamed itself
	  Neterion.  So, the adapters might be labeled as either one, depending
	  on its age.
