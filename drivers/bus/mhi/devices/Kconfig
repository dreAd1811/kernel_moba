	  MHI proxy satellite device driver enables NON-HLOS MHI satellite
	  drivers to communicate with device over PCIe link without host
	  involvement. Host facilitates propagation of events from device
	  to NON-HLOS MHI satellite drivers, channel states, and power
	  management over IPC communication. It helps in HLOS power
	  savings.
